# SmogCast: Predicting & Forecasting Air Quality in India

**SmogCast** is an end-to-end air quality analytics and forecasting system that transforms raw air-pollution sensor data into **actionable insights**.  
It performs **real-time AQI classification** and **7-day forecasting** of particulate matter (PM2.5 & PM10) using a hybrid machine-learning and deep-learning pipeline.

 **Live App:** https://smogcast.streamlit.app/  
 **Demo Video:** https://youtu.be/UyUvtBF0N3Q

## Streamlit Dashboard Preview

The SmogCast dashboard provides an intuitive interface for monitoring **current air quality** and **future pollution trends** across major Indian cities.

### Full Dashboard Overview

## Key Visual Components

### AQI Classification & Severity Gauge

This gauge visualizes the **current AQI category** mapped to CPCB color-coded breakpoints (Green → Maroon), allowing instant assessment of air quality severity. Adjecent to it we have the AQI classification label along with recommendation message.

### 7-Day Forecast (Bi-LSTM vs Transformer)

Compares forecasting behavior across deep-learning models.
The **Bi-LSTM** produces smoother, more stable trends, while the **Transformer** reacts more sharply to daily fluctuations.

### Daily AQI Trend

Displays short-term AQI fluctuations for the selected city, revealing smog spikes, recovery phases, and temporal patterns.

### Pollutant Composition

Illustrates the relative contribution of dominant pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, etc.) to the city’s overall air quality.

## Methodology Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Processing Pipeline

* **Hierarchical Imputation**

  * City-level median fill
  * Zero-fill fallback for missing sensors
* **Temporal Aggregation**

  * Hourly → Daily averages
* **Feature Engineering**

  * Lag features (t-1)
  * 7-day rolling means
  * Cyclical time encoding (sin/cos)
* **Scaling**

  * Log1p transformation
  * MinMax scaling to [0,1]

---

### 2️⃣ AQI Classification (CatBoost)

* Multi-class AQI prediction (Good → Severe)
* Native handling of categorical city features
* SMOTE applied to improve minority (“Severe”) detection
* **Global Test Accuracy:** **92.39%**
* **High Precision (>94%)** for Severe AQI events

### 3️⃣ Forecasting Models

| Model                   | Strengths                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bi-Directional LSTM** | Smooth, stable forecasts; lowest MAE                    |
| **Transformer**         | Captures long-range dependencies but sensitive to noise |

**Key Insight:**

> For this dataset size, the Bi-LSTM outperformed the Transformer, demonstrating that simpler architectures can outperform more complex models when data quality and feature engineering are strong.
